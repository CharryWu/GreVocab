You can also roll out dough for a pie â by flattening it with a rolling pin â or roll up a car window, which once required turning a handle, but today usually involves pushing a button.

From the Greekanthropogenes, meaning ""born of man,”anthropogeniccan refer to any changes in nature that are caused by people — like the existence of roads or cities where once there were forests. Most often, you will hearanthropogenicas an adjective describing pollution — such as the anthropogenic causes of the hole in the ozone layer."

It has been suggested thatrecantwas first used when someone reversed a charm, curse, or some other type of magical spell that would have been chanted or sung.

If you're a witness in a trial, you'll be asked to take an oath in which you'llavowthat you'll tell the truth.",公开宣布,"A simple way to remember the meaning ofavowis that it sounds and looks a whole lot like ""a vow,"" to which it's closely related. At the end of almost every wedding, the couple takes their vows, in which they avow their commitment to each other. To take a vow is to avow the things that you say in that vow. Be sure that you mean what you say when you avow something, because people will hold you to it. And don't mutter or mumble. That's no way to avow something."

If you run into someone that you have a crush on you might feel nervousness with aconcomitantforgetfulness.,伴随,"Concomitantis one of those Latin-based words you can break down into little pieces:conmeans with, andcomitmeans companion. So something that is concomitant is like the companion of the main event.

The 200-year-old newspaper covering the royal wedding might be called anaugustinstitution.,庄严的,"The month August was named for Augustus Caesar who was an important and regal person. This is an easy way to remember the two meanings. Interestingly enough, linguists think that the wordaugustdid not descend from the same root as the month August. Find that hard to believe?

If you have a disagreement with a friend that you continue for weeks and weeks, you areprotractingthe argument.",vt 延期…计划／行程表,"Protractcan also mean to draw a plan to scale.

Well, considering it was you who let your pigs run roughshod over my lawn, I think it's clear that it's you who aggrieved me. Or, to put it another way, I've been aggrieved by you and your horrible hogs.

When you exonerate someone, you clear a person of an accusation and any suspicion that goes along with it.Exculpateusually refers more directly to clearing the charges against someone.

If you launch into adisquisitionabout toe jam at a party, you'll soon be talking to a wall.",博士论文,"If you write a paper that looks at every single aspect of a topic, that essay can be called a disquisition. If you have a strong interest in something, chances are your friends and family have heard you give passionate disquisitions on it. Adisquisitionis an incredibly thorough reporting on a topic. Think of it as a discourse or a discussion of an inquisition or long investigation."
jejune,,"Use the adjective jejune to describe something that is uninteresting or insignificant. Many people claim to find celebrity gossip jejune, but ask them about a recent movie star scandal and chances are they know all about it.",幼稚的，无聊的话题／八卦，没有精神／智力营养的,"Jejune can also describe something that’s immature or simplistic. All that actress could say about her latest movie was that it was “Super fun”? That’s a pretty jejune comment. Basically jejune means lacking substance. It originally comes from the Latin word jejunus, which means “fasting,” so when something is jejune, it’s figuratively empty — devoid of intellectual nourishment."
insouciance,,"Insouciance is a feeling of careless indifference. There's a certain amount of lightheartedness in insouciance, but rather than merely being cheerful, someone with insouciance truly couldn't care less.",漫不经心,"nsouciance has roots in the French in, meaning not, and se soucier, meaning ""to care,"" giving the English word its ""uncaring"" meaning. Insouciance can be a positive state — like the childlike insouciance you feel when you are watching cartoons instead of paying your bills. However, insouciance is not always so sunny. Young voters are often accused of treating the right to vote with insouciance, meaning they just can't be bothered."
abstemious,,,"克制自己的 不要和神秘的搞混了",
adjudicate,,"To adjudicate is to act like a judge. A judge might adjudicate a case in court, and you may have to adjudicate in the local talent show.","正式判决 担任法官的职责去判决/评论某事 adjudicate on something","Do you see a similarity between judge and adjudicate? When you add the common Latin prefix ad meaning ""to"" or ""toward,"" you have a pretty good idea what the word means. But a judge isn't the only person who can adjudicate. If you're fighting with your little brother or sister and make them cry, your parents may adjudicate and send you to your room.

bog down,,You'd be pretty soggy by morning if you accidentally set your tent up in a bog. A bog is a swampy kind of ground made up mostly of decomposing plants and mosses.,"被...所缠身 bog down in detail拘泥于细节","Nothing can be built on a bog because the ground is so spongy and damp, and no crops can be grown there. The dried soil from a bog can, however, be dried and burned for fuel. A figurative bog is anything that you tend to get stuck in, like a bog of health problems. Things can also ""bog you down"", or slow you down literally or figuratively, like when your homework bogs you down so you can't enjoy the weekend."
perish,,"Perish means to die, but it suggests a slow, gradual, nonviolent death. Starving to death is perishing. Getting hit by a bus is just plain getting killed.",缓慢地死亡／凋零,"Perish is the kind of word you can imagine being spoken by a helpless princess in a fairy tale or any other damsel in distress––""If I am not rescued soon by my valiant knight,"" she might say, ""I shall perish if I'm left alone up here in this tower to starve."""
encounter,,"If you run into that cute guy (or girl) from the local deli when you’re at the grocery store and you stop to chat, you’ve just had an encounter, which is a casual meeting, often resulting by chance.
",与某人邂夠,"When you encounter the word encounter, context will tell you if it’s acting as a verb or a noun. The sentence “When Spencer and Susanna encountera bear on the trail, they stand very still” illustrates the verb form. “The encounter in the subway left her wishing she had stayed at home” shows the noun form. Whether acting as a verb or a noun, the word carries the connotation of “chance meeting."" You don’t plan an encounter; it just happens."
predate,,"To predate is to happen or exist before something else. If you move into a house that already has a ghost, the ghost predates you. Boo!",先于...存在／发生,"If your interest in soul music predates your sister's, you loved it first. When you use predate this way, you can read it as a combination of pre-, ""before,"" and date, ""point in time."" Another meaning of this verb is ""to prey on for food,"" so you could say that your cat predates the mice that live in your kitchen. This definition stems from predator, from the Latin praedator, ""plunderer."""
indescretion,,If you commit an indiscretion you are doing something wrong that shows a lack of judgment. Perhaps stealing candy was your first indiscretion. Likely it will not be your last.,"commit an indiscretion 不理智的行为","You'll often hear the word indiscretion used when referring to politicians or public figures caught in a scandal. Used this way, the word implies poor judgment for both the wrong and the fact that the politician got caught. If you are going to commit an indiscretion, it's best to be a bit discreet, or subtle, about it."
mundane,,"An ordinary, unexciting thing can be called mundane: ""Superman hid his heroic feats by posing as his mundane alter ego, Clark Kent.""",枯燥无味的，世俗的,"Mundane, from the Latin word mundus, ""world,"" originally referred to things on earth. Such things were supposed to be uninteresting when compared to the delights of Heaven; hence the word's present meaning. Writing about reality TV shows, a Newsweek writer opined, ""In reality bizarro-world, the mundane is presented as the spectacular"" — in other words, people's everyday routines are now televised as entertainment."
ebullient,,"More than chipper, more than happy, more than delighted is ebullient — meaning bubbling over with joy and delight.",(短期或长期)充满热情的,"There are two senses of the word of ebullient. One describes an immediate, and ultimately short-lived, reaction to a particular event — for example if you've just won the lottery, you are ebullient. The other describes someone who is perpetually upbeat and cheerful, for example, as in ""an ebullient personality."" Watch out for ebullient personalities: they can often be ""over the top"" as well."
measured,,"Things done in a deliberate, rhythmic way are measured. When you're walking toward a deer in the woods, trying not to scare it off, you'll take slow, measured steps.",沉着的（步伐，神态），有分寸的（企图／玩笑）,"When you meditate, you take measured breaths and pay attention to the inhale and exhale. And your measured strides up the side of a mountain trail will carry you more quickly to the top than short, erratic bursts of walking and stopping. Measured also means ""thoughtful"" or ""careful,"" like the measured words you use in your delicately worded resignation letter."
rudimentary,,"Rudimentary means basic, or at a very early stage. The test should be easy: it requires only a rudimentaryunderstanding of the materials.",未成熟的,The word rude means simple or offensive––people with only rudimentary understanding of good manners might not know how that belching is rude. Remember that the word rude is the foundation of rudimentary you'll have a rudimentary understanding of the word.
offset,a compensation equivalent,"When you offset something—say, the price of gas—you find a way to make up for it. My new car's ability to get fifty miles per gallon offset the rise in the price of gas. Offset functions as both a noun and a verb.",抵消,"Okay, let's talk turkey. The Duke's lack of height was offset by his enormous wig. Even without shoes, he towered above most people, because his wig alone was five feet tall. The cost of the wig—close to $10,000—was easily offset by its quality: it was worth every cent. The inconvenience of the blizzard was offset by the joy of not having to go to school or work—or even get out of bed. The joy was what you might call an offset."
dour,,"Dour describes something sullen, gloomy, or persistent. You might look dour on your way to picking up your last check from the job you just got fired from, and people should get out of your way.
",阴沉的,"Dour and endure most likely come from the Latin word durus which means ""hard."" If something is hard to endure for a long enough time, it can make even the most happy-go-lucky person dour. Dour sounds like sour (or closer to ""do-er""). It's a tomato/tamahto word, but either way — if you're in a sour mood, you have no sense of humor, and you're dour."
tepid,,"Tepid means lukewarm or half-hearted. If the applause for your mime-on-a-unicycle performance was more tepid than enthusiastic, it might be time to find a new hobby.",不太热情的; 冷冰冰的,"Around 1400, the word tepid evolved from the Latin tepidus, an adjective meaning “lukewarm,” which before that came about from the Latin tepere, a verb meaning “to be warm.” Tepid people or things are lukewarm or lacking in enthusiasm or emotion. Bathwater that’s been sitting in the tub for two hours is probably tepid. So was the hug you gave your least favorite ex when you ran into him at the movie theater."
champion,,"A champion is a winner, or someone who's really good at something. If you are a champion chess player, you are a superstar! When crowds sing Queen's ""We Are the Champions"" at football games, they are celebrating the fact that their team won.
",赢家；…的坚定支持者,"Champion comes from the Latin word campionem for ""gladiator, fighter."" Rarr! No need to grab your sword, but a champion is also a person who fights for a cause. If you are the champion of fundraising, you keep pushing to raise money. As a verb, to champion means to protect or fight for something. You champion your little brother by defending him against meanies — no matter what, you are always on his side."
hamstring,,hamstring本意是韧带,削减某人／某物的实力,
puerile,,,幼稚的,
excoriate,,"When it comes to “telling someone off,” excoriate is reserved for the most severe cases. So, before you excoriate your little sister for borrowing your favorite jacket without permission, consider whether she truly deserves such harsh treatment.",比censure还要严重的谴责,"If you excoriate someone, you let that person know that you really, reallydisagree with them. This verb goes beyond mere criticism; it implies anger, a harsh and insulting tone, and even a scathing attack. Synonyms of excoriate include denounce, decry, and condemn. In a medical sense, excoriate means “to tear skin off by chafing.” A bad rug burn can excoriate your skin. If someone excoriates you verbally, it might make you feel like you’ve been physically excoriated."
hew to,,,遵守,
veil,,,掩盖,
mien,,"Your mien is how you present yourself, the impression you make. It's best to keep a low profile but a dignified mien.
",神态,"The source of the word mien is not completely clear, but it does involve a French word for ""facial expression."" A person's mien is a look or quality that tells a lot about their personalities or temperaments. A person with a cheerful mien probably radiates happiness and energy, while someone with a serious mien may have an air of being lost in thought."
assiduous,,"If you call someone assiduous, it's a compliment. It means they're careful, methodical and very persistent. Good detectives are classically assiduous types.","指人：连贯一致地努力，细心的 指活动：需要细心的努力","Assiduous comes from two Latin words: assiduus, meaning ""busy incessant, continual or constant,"" and assidere, meaning ""to sit down to"" something. (Funnily enough, we also get the word sedentary, meaning someone who doesn't move around much, a lazy couch potato, from this same last word.) Although we tend to think of sedentary types as being the very opposite of assiduous ones, many assiduous activities (like writing, thinking, or detective work) are best done sitting in a chair."
retrenchment,,,"=downsizing=curtailment 削减资金",
nebulous,,"Something that's nebulous is clouded or hazy. When you walk through the woods on a foggy morning, the trees may all have a mysterious, nebulous look to them.",物理上或概念上：模糊的,"When you fly in a plane on an overcast day, the land below you looks nebulous and indistinct. You can also use nebulous in a more figurative way, to describe vague ideas or fuzzy concepts. Nebulous comes from the Latin nebulosus, ""cloudy, misty, or foggy."" Its root is nebula, which is ""vapor or fog"" in Latin and was adopted by astronomers in the 1700s to mean ""a cloud of gas and dust in outer space."""
overblown,,"Overblown describes fears or concerns that are excessive, such as a overblown worry that people will notice a spot of dirt on your shoe and decide not to be your friend anymore.",过度的（焦虑／恐惧／显摆装饰）,"Overblown is a word gardeners use to describe their flowers that, having bloomed, now hang heavy on their stems. You can use it to describe other things that are past their prime like an overblown fashion trend everyone is tired of. Another meaning is an extreme display of vanity, like the overblown decorating style of a famous actor's home — complete with photos, memorabilia from past films, and award trophies everywhere you look."
oversell,,,超卖；夸张的推销或吹嘘,
extirpate,,"The verb extirpate originally literally meant ""to weed out by the roots."" Now you'd use it when you want to get rid of something completely as if pulling it up by the root.",斩草除根,"Use the verb extirpate when you mean to destroy completely or get rid of completely. You can try to extirpate all the bedbugs that came home with you from your vacation, but you will probably be afraid that some resisted the exterminator to munch on you later."
efficacious,,,真正有效的,
misfeasance,,"Misfeasance happens when someone in authority uses her position to do something wrong. If a town's mayor uses his influence to get jobs for his family members, that's misfeasance.", 渎职；利用职位之便进行不法行为,"One way to define misfeasance is ""the wrongful exercise of lawful authority."" In other words, the power or authority is legal and fair, but the way it's being used is harmful. If a judge, sheriff, city councilor, or other public official acts in a way they know will cause harm, it's considered misfeasance. This legal term comes from an Old French word, mesfaire, ""to misdo,"" which combines the roots mes-, ""wrongly,"" and faire, ""to do."""
salutary,,"Use salutary to describe something that's good for your health, like the salutary benefits of exercise, laughter, and getting enough sleep every night.",效果好的,"When you look at the word salutary, you might expect it to have something to do with showing respect to military personnel, perhaps by saluting. In fact, salutary and salute do share a Latin root: salus, which means ""good health."" When you salute someone, or say ""Salud!"" before clinking glasses and taking a first sip, you're essentially giving your salutary wish — in other words, hoping a person enjoys good health."
controvert,,"If you controvert something, you dispute it. If you argue for a new pony, your parents will controvert your argument by pointing out you said the same thing about the dog — the one they have to walk.",争论,"The verb controvert can mean to prove to be false or untrue. If you are a historian, you know that new evidence often controverts commonly-held beliefs, so history is constantly being revised and updated. Many children grew up learning that Christopher Columbus landed first in America, but now we have evidence to controvert that idea and other explorers such as Leif Eriksson beat Columbus to America."
pious,,"If someone is deeply religious and visibly follows all the moral and ethical codes of his religion, he is pious. Don't become a priest if you're not prepared to live a piouslife.
",指外表：看起来虔诚的。devout也是虔诚的，但是是内心中真正虔诚的,"Pious comes from the Latin pius, which means dutiful. It doesn't always have to be used to talk about organized religion. If someone believes deeply in something, and lets everyone see it through their behavior, then they are pious, whether they're pious Christians or pious environmentalists. It differs from its synonym devout, which implies deep religious sentiment, whereas pious emphasizes the public display of feeling."
sustain,,"Sustain means to support something or keep it going. If you get hungry in the mid-afternoon, you might try snacking to sustain your energy through dinner.
",（法律）用证据证明／支持某个观点,"The verb controvert can mean to prove to be false or untrue. If you are a historian, you know that new evidence often controverts commonly-held beliefs, so history is constantly being revised and updated.

stupefaction,,"the action of stupefying; making dull or lethargic

Don't get caught in a blatant lie, because you won't be able to weasel your way out of it.",（指某事或某种行为r）嚣张的，毫不掩饰的,"Blatant acts are done without trying to hide them. This adjective is probably from Latin blaterare ""to chatter, croak"" or Latin blatīre ""to chatter, gossip."" A near synonym is flagrant."
worldly,,You can use the adjective worldly to describe people who have knowledge of many topics or experience in many areas. You don't have to travel the globe to be worldly; reading and talking about many things with knowledge and enthusiasm is worldly too.,（为人处事）有经验的,"While worldly often describes individuals who are sophisticated and well-rounded in education, travel, and experiences, it's also used for people who are rooted in the world or focused on physical and material things around them, rather than on spiritual matters. An old expression in religion is ""She was too heavenly minded for worldly good,"" and it describes those who think about the spiritual or supernatural so much that they aren't worldly enough to get anything done."
diverting,,Something that's diverting is a pleasant distraction. A movie on a long bus ride — even a bad movie — is diverting.,有趣的=intriguing,"The adjective diverting describes anything that grabs your attention, especially if it's entertaining and distracts from something less interesting. Spending time with a friend can be diverting when you're waiting to hear important news or get the results of a big test, and a good, diverting book is the perfect thing to take on a boring train commute. Diverting stems from the verb divert, or ""distract,"" from its Latin root, divertere, ""to turn in different directions."""
culpability,,Culpability is a state of guilt or responsibility. A lot of lawsuits are about who has culpability for something that went wrong.,有罪的," Culpability is a fancy-sounding word, but it's a simple concept: guilt. You have culpability if you're responsible for something, usually something bad. If you left the door open and your house was robbed, you have some culpability (not as much as the robber, though). If a store owner doesn't salt the ice on the sidewalk and you slip, he has some culpability if you get injured. Figuring out culpability is about figuring out who's to blame."
indiscriminate,,"Nuclear bombs are indiscriminate, as are earthquakes. They affect everyone in their path rather than picking or choosing. When something is indiscriminate, it makes no fine distinctions.","混合的 = heterogeneous 不加分辨的，不加选择的","A dog who eats everything could be said to have indiscriminate taste. If you walk into a store and buy the first pair of pants in your size, no matter what they look like, you are an indiscriminate shopper. Usually though, you'll hear the word used to describe violent acts or natural events because these things do not have a specific target. They affect all people without considering the differences in their lives."
iconoclastic,,"The word iconoclastic is an adjective referring to a breaking of established rules or destruction of accepted beliefs. It might refer to an artist with an unorthodox style, or an iconoclastic attack, either physical or verbal, on a religious doctrine or image.",指人或社会变化：破除旧规的,"Consider the Greek word eikōn, or ""image,"" coupled with -klastēs, ""one who breaks,"" and you get a good image of someone who is iconoclastic. An iconoclastic approach to religion involves tearing down the icons representing the church. While this was once done physically, through riots and mayhem, today’s iconoclasts usually prefer using words. Not all iconoclasts are destructive, however. An iconoclastic approach to art and music has given rise to the development of new genres and styles through breaking the rules."
fret,,"When you fret, you worry so much about something that it eats away at you. Many people fret about taking standardized tests, but really, they're nothing to sweat.",坐立不安；因一点小事而被激怒,"Fret comes from the Old English word freton which means to devour like an animal. When you fret over something, it consumes your thoughts. If you tell your mother to not fret about you while you're at a sleepover camp, you're telling her to not worry about you too much. Sometimes it means to be agitated though. When you're waiting for the results of an exam, you might fret and wring your hands. In a totally unrelated meaning, a guitar player calls the raised lines on the neck of the guitar that help him play correctly frets."
outlandish,,"If something is outlandish it's bizarre or unfamiliar, far outside the boundaries of expected or normal behavior. Driving around the city in a golf cart and eating spaghetti with pineapple sauce are both examples of outlandish behavior.",特别标新立异的（不用来指外国人）,"t's easy to imagine how the word outlandish originated. The Old English root is utland, which literally means ""out-land,"" or foreign. Now, it would be inappropriate to refer to a foreigner as outlandish, unless, say, he shows up to the office in a red patent-leather Speedo and a ten-gallon hat."
torpor,,"Torpor is a state of mental and physical inactivity. ""After a huge Thanksgiving meal, my family members fall into a torpor; no one can even pick up the TV remote.""",沉睡，无能量无反应的状态,"Torpor can be used in everyday speech, but it's also a scientific term for a state of deep sleep that allows animals to conserve energy. Certain species of bats, birds, and frogs rely on torpor for survival during tough times. While humans don't technically belong to this group of animals, they certainly appear to, especially after a large meal and on most Monday mornings."
sway,,"Back and forth...back and forth...back and forth...are you sea-sick yet? The sway, or rocking motion, of a boat is too much for many stomachs.",指人或决定：被他人所左右的；指物理运动：摇摆,"People can sway if they're dizzy, tilting from side to side as they walk. On a windy day you can see trees swaying and bending in the wind. Swaying is usually a gentle motion, but if you're easily swayed, you're in trouble. That means you're easily influenced by others. People of power often ""hold sway"" over their followers, controlling them with the seeming ease of the breeze."
defy,,,拒不服从（法律或规则）,
conclusive,,"If you've got a theory that you're trying to prove, and you uncover a conclusive piece of evidence, then the case is closed. Conclusive means you've got your answer, you've proved your theory, and there can't be any doubt about it.",指证据：结论性的，无可置疑的,"If want to prove that frogs can speak, and you record a frog reciting ""The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere,"" that would be conclusive evidence for your claim. But if the frog mumbled and might have been just making frog noises, critics would say that your video is not conclusive. You can also use the word conclusive to describe winning something easily or by a large margin, like when the judges handed the tap-dancing bear a conclusive victory, and he moved on triumphantly to the finals."
rehash,,"When you rehash something, you use it again without altering or changing it much. Your favorite band's new album will be a disappointment if they just rehash all their old hits.",特指艺术作品：重复利用之前的形式的,"Sometimes movie sequels are great films in their own right, but often they simply rehash the storyline, characters, and jokes from the original. You can call a movie like this a rehash. Another way to rehash is to go over something again, rethinking or reconsidering it: ""She just wants to rehash that argument, trying to figure out why her friend got so angry."""
subversion,,"Subversion means overthrowing something, like a government or law, or it can mean corrupting someone’s personal morals, like making a vegetarian eat bacon by tricking her.",颠覆,"The Latin root subvertere means “to turn from below,” and when you turn something on its head in a sneaky way, that’s subversion. Imagine digging a hole in the ground, then covering the hole with a layer of sticks and leaves. When someone walks on it, they fall in. That’s the basic idea of subversion, attacking from below. People often use subversion to take down a corrupt government, and acts of subversion are a powerful way to protest injustice."
espouse,,"Use the verb espouse to describe the actions of someone who lives according to specific beliefs, such as your friends who espouseenvironmentalism and as a result walk whenever possible instead of taking the car.",支持，赞成,"You can see the word spouse in espouse, so you may be wondering what husbands and wives have to do with it. Originally espouse did mean ""to marry,"" but its meaning has evolved to include other long-term commitments as well, such as support for a principle or a cause. Similar to marriage, if you espouse a belief system, the idea is that you've chosen to wed yourself to it."
liken,,"When you liken one thing to another, you compare them and point out what they have in common. You might liken your long walk to school to your ancestors' voyage across the ocean to the New World.",人指出某两件事物的相同之处,"When you equate two things, or emphasize their similarities, you liken them. You could liken your experience at the dentist to torture, or liken your dad's skill at baking pies to that of Rembrandt painting a portrait. Your grandmother might liken her romance with your grandfather to a fairy tale, and you could then liken the day you spent listening to her stories to watching a long, dull movie."
dilatory,,"Something dilatory creates a delay. If you are a high school student, once in a while you might have used dilatory tactics if you forgot to do your homework.",拖拉的,"The adjective dilatory comes from the Latin root word dilator, a noun that means someone who puts off things, or a procrastinator. If you are always late to appointments, people may accuse you of being dilatory, especially if they think you don't have a good excuse."
quell,,"Meaning to suppress or overcome, quell is what you have to do with nerves before a big test and fears before going skydiving.",完全镇压 = quench；减轻…程度,"When it first came into existence, the verb quell actually meant “to murder.” That's a bit more serious than our modern definition, but you can use that old definition to help you imagine offing your worries or putting a permanent end to criticism. These days quell is often used to mean ""pacify,"" as in the police quelling an angry mob or a mom quelling a kid's temper tantrum."

deadlock,,"Use the noun deadlock to describe a standstill, as when two people or sides cannot move beyond a disagreement.",僵局,"Deadlock can also mean a game that results in an unbreakable tie or a stalemate, like when you are in a five-hour thumb-wrestling match with no winner. You can easily remember the meaning of this compound word, by thinking about its two word parts — dead + lock. The first appearance of deadlock was in The Critic, a play by Richard Brinsley Sheridan: “I have them all at a deadlock, for every one of them is afraid to let go first.”"
malleable,,"A malleable personality is capable of being changed or trained, and a malleable metal is able to be pounded or pressed into various shapes. It's easier to learn when you're young and malleable.",金属：容易被塑造成形的,"Similarly, there are ductile metals that can be hammered out into wire or thread; gold, silver, and platinum are examples. The adjective malleable dates back to Middle English, from Old French, from Medieval Latin malleābilis, from malleāre ""to hammer,"" from Latin malleus ""a hammer."""

proscription,,"To proscribe something is to forbid or prohibit it, as a school principal might proscribe the use of cell phones in class.",禁令,"Proscribe sounds similar to the word prescribe, but be careful: these words are essentially opposite in meaning. While proscribe means forbid, prescribe is used when a doctor recommends a medicine or remedy. Of course, if you want an excuse for not following your doctor’s orders, you could say you were confused about the meaning of these two words — but that would be lying, which is proscribed by most people’s value systems. And it would also be bad for your health.

exculpation,,"To exculpate means to find someone not guilty of criminal charges. If you've been wrongly accused of robbery, you'd better hope a judge will exculpate you, unless you want to go to jail because you've heard prison food is amazing.","=exonerate 赦免罪名","Exculpate comes from two Latin words: ex-, meaning ""from,"" and culpa, meaning ""blame."" Exculpate is similar in meaning to exonerate. When you exonerate someone, you clear a person of an accusation and any suspicion that goes along with it. Exculpate usually refers more directly to clearing the charges against someone. So if that judge exculpates you from the robbery charge, everyone in town might still think you did it. Get him to exculpate and exonerate you."
imprudence,,"Imprudence sometimes gets people in trouble, because it means a lack of care or thoughtfulness. The imprudence of not wearing your gloves in the winter might result in frostbite on your fingers.",不精明，不谨慎,"A person's imprudence is her tendency to rush headlong into decisions or actions without careful contemplation. Imprudence could lead a couple to get married just a week after meeting each other or a little girl to chase a run-away ball into a busy street. The Latin root word is imprudentem means ""not forseeing, unaware, or inconsiderate."""
uncanny,,"If something is uncanny, it is so mysterious, strange, or unfamiliar that it seems supernatural. If you hear strange music echoing through your attic, you might refer to it as positively uncanny.",不寻常的,"You can also use uncanny to refer to something that is so remarkable that it is beyond what is natural: as in ""uncanny abilities."" This adjective was formed in English from the prefix un- ""not"" and canny ""fortunate, safe."" The current meaning of English canny is ""careful and clever, especially in handling money."""
aggrandize,,"If you are a window washer, but you refer to yourself as a ""vista enhancement specialist,"" then you are aggrandizing your job title — that is, making it sound greater than it is.",使某人／某个团体的影响力／财富／名气增加,"The verb aggrandize not only means ""to make appear greater""; it can also be used to mean simply ""to make greater."" If you buy an estate and sink millions of dollars into its improvement, then you are actually aggrandizing the estate. If you are making yourself seem greater, then people may say you are ""self-aggrandizing."""
self-aggrandizing,,exhibiting self-importance,喜欢炫耀自己的,
emergent,,"If you have an emergent talent for science, your teacher might bump you up to an advanced science class. Emergent is an adjective that describes something that is emerging, or suddenly coming into existence.",新兴的（技术），正在变得重要／牛逼的,"Emergent means “coming into being.” It's often used in phrases like “emergent technologies.” These are brand-new technologies that we can expect to be widely used in the near future. The Internet, for example, was an emergent technology in the early 1990s. Emergent sometimes implies that what is coming into being is surprising and demands a response. An “emergent disease,” for instance, would send scientists scrambling to find a cure. In this sense emergent is related to emergency."

effluvia,,"Effluvium is a smelly gas, vapor, or an exhalation. You wouldn't want to breathe in the effluvium from a cargo ship or you might become ill. Stick to sailing.",古英语：恶臭的气体,"Not a particularly common word these days, effluvium dates back to the 1600's, meaning ""a flowing out of air."" Since the effluvium seeping out of the tire factory's chimney was invisible, park officials took months to realize fumes were killing hundreds of birds. The Romans were the first to invent a sewage system, thereby diverting effluvium into the drains and out of the city. Thank you, Romans."
malodorous,,"You can use the adjective malodorous as a nicer way to say that something's stinky. Maybe you think your feet smell like roses, but if people move far away when your shoes come off, your rosy feet are probably malodorous.",=stinky臭气熏天的,"Mal- is used to form words for bad things, and in this case, mal-odor-ous means having a bad odor. Synonyms for malodorous include ""smelly,"" ""rank,"" and ""funky"" — but not funky in a ""get on with your bad self"" good way, just funky bad. If you walk into a malodorous room, you might start checking the bottoms of your shoes to see if you stepped in something, and if a plate of malodorous food is served, you might cover your nose and mouth."
redolent,,"When something is redolent of something, it makes you think of that thing by making a pretty strong impression on you. He had a shifty eye redolent of years of lying and petty crime.","redolent of sth. 令人回想起以前某个事物的 芳香的 ","People used to use redolent of something with a strong, distinctive odor. Now, think of it as ""stinks of"" — but in a fancy way. If you're touring an old castle, you might say that the worn carpet and handsome woodwork are redolent of the place's former glory, though otherwise it's a dump."
anodyne,,"When your back is killing you from helping your friend move furniture into his new apartment, you need to take an anodyne, a painkiller.",止痛的,"An anodyne doesn’t have to be actual medicine. If the pure joy of helping your friend is soothing enough to make you forget your aching back, that counts as an anodyne too (though perhaps an unlikely one). Anodyne can also be used as an adjective to describe something that relieves pain, or is at least inoffensive. When you’re stressed out or unhappy, try looking at anodyne pictures of kittens. Er, unless you had a bad experience with a cat once."
pecuniary,,"If something has to do with money, it's pecuniary. If your grandfather's antique watch has pecuniary value, it's worth money — you could sell it for cash if you weren't sentimentally attached to keeping it.",以钱为形式的（补偿或者价值）,"Pecuniary might seem like a peculiar word for talking about money, but it all adds up when you learn that it was the worth of the cattle, or pecū in Latin, that gave pecuniary its meaning. In Roman times, livestock served as money in making transactions. Some cultures still have economies based on cattle, but most modern societies have a pecuniary system based on, well, money."
formulaic,,"Anything formulaic follows a formula or pattern, especially in a mechanical, by-the-numbers way. A formulaic TV show is predictable and probably similar to lots of other shows.",缺乏创新的，传统迂腐的,"Have you ever noticed how many songs are similar to others? When a song is almost identical to previous songs and it’s not very original at all, it's formulaic. This word usually conveys a lack of imagination. If you call a movie formulaic, you're saying it's so much like other movies that it probably didn't need to be made. A formulaic speech follows a pattern that's been used many times before. The opposite of formulaic is original."

milieu,,"A milieu is a surrounding culture. Your family, house, neighborhood, school, and people you hang out with make up your milieu. If you live in a mansion and have rich friends, you’re part of the upper crust milieu. Go you.",社会环境,"A milieu is both ""surroundings"" and everything that makes up the surroundings. Your milieu is your world, or the context you come from. Sometimes a milieu shapes a person, as when a ""milieu of abuse and poverty,"" inspires someone to improve things for others. Milieu sounds a lot like mildew without the ""d,"" but unless you grew up in a moldy bathtub, mildew probably has little to do with your milieu, or environment."
eschew,,"If you eschew something, you deliberately avoid it. If you live the bohemian life in the city, then most likely you eschew the suburbs.",躲避某事,"Eschew comes from a word meaning dread, or shun. So to eschew something isn’t simply to avoid it, the way you would avoid walking in a puddle––it's stronger than that. You eschew things that you find morally or aesthetically wrong, or that you have chosen to find wrong. A dieter might eschew a chocolate sundae, not because he doesn’t like it, but because he’s afraid of what it will do to his waistline."
cede,,"To cede is to give up or surrender land, position, or authority. ""She reluctantly ceded the coveted position as the baby of the family to her brother when he was born. She would not, however, cede her bedroom to him.""",割让；拱手让人,"Cede is a word often used in discussing diplomatic issues.

experimental,"1. of the nature of or undergoing an experiment

Anexperimentaldrug is usually tested in a lab for years before being used on patients.,革新性的（艺术作品）,"Something that's experimental is at an early stage, being observed, tested out, and subjected to experiments as it's being developed. An experimental space craft might be launched and watched from afar as scientists decide what changes to make before it can be used for human space exploration.

We tend to useobscurein the metaphorical senses: an obscure sound is unclear, an obscure village is hidden away in the countryside, and an obscure poet is little known and probably insignificant.Obscurecan also be used as a verb.

When a thing or process isinexorable, it can't be stopped.",(贬义)难以打动的，顽固不化的,"This is a word for people and things that will not change direction. An inexorable person is hard-headed and cannot be convinced to change their mind, no matter what. You can also say that a process, like the progress of a deadly illness, is inexorable because it can't be stopped. A speeding train with no brakes is inexorable; it's not stopping till it crashes. When you see the wordinexorable, think ""No one's stopping that."""

anew,1. again but in a new or different way,"When something happensanew, it happens again, but in a fresh way that might be different.",以新的形势重现展现／发生,"Anewis a word to describe things that happen again but are more than just a rerun. If a couple takes their marriage vows anew, it's a little different than the first time. If a clothes trend happens anew, it's a revival of the original trend that probably won't be identical.

truism,1. an obvious truth,"Here's atruismfor you: Only people who look up words they don't know can expand their vocabularies. Did you find that statement obvious, boring, and saying nothing new or interesting? That's the perfect description of atruism.",显而易见的真相（废话）,"Sometimes truisms can be mistaken for factual statements. In fact, despite their seeming obviousness, they are usually opinions. Many people who look up words in the dictionary don't improve their vocabularies, as much as they'd like to.

So, when you think aboutconsolidate, think about bringing things together to make something solid, stronger, or easier to handle.
